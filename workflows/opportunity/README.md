# Opportunity Workflow ✅

**Where it sits:** the convergent close of **diamond one** — you've done wide, unstructured discovery and now need to *align the team on the opportunity worth pursuing* before ideating.

**What it produces:**
1. A populated **Opportunity Canvas** (the team's shared working surface)
2. A polished **Opportunity Brief** as a formatted `.docx` (the stakeholder's narrative doc)

**Inspired by** Jeff Patton's [Opportunity Canvas](https://www.jpattonassociates.com/opportunity-canvas/), adapted with Teresa Torres's opportunity framing (problems + desires = opportunities), an evidence-first empathy pass, and an HMW exit that tees up ideation.

> ▶ **New here?** Type `/generate <canvas title>` in Claude Code (or paste [`01-generate.md`](01-generate.md) into Claude) and go. The three stages below explain the full flow.

## The three stages

| Stage | Who | What happens | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Generate** | 🤖 Claude | Produces a blank, well-structured Opportunity Canvas for the team to fill in. | [`01-generate.md`](01-generate.md) |
| **2. Populate** | 👥 Team | The team fills the canvas in offline, collaboratively (Miro / whiteboard). | [`02-populate.md`](02-populate.md) |
| **3. Synthesise** | 🤖 Claude | Takes the messy populated canvas (screenshots, transcripts, chat) + the brief template and produces the Opportunity Brief `.docx`. | [`03-synthesise.md`](03-synthesise.md) |

> **Ideation happens off-canvas.** The canvas closes with a stack-rank of HMWs that *tees up* ideation — but the divergent solution-generation itself belongs to the [Ideation Workflow](../ideation/), not this one.

## Canvas schema (overview)

The full schema lives in [`templates/opportunity-canvas.md`](templates/opportunity-canvas.md). Sections, in order:

1. **Customer problem & desire — the opportunity** — what they're trying to do; problems + desires = opportunities (Torres).
2. **Empathy pass** — say / think / do / feel, on real evidence; guesses marked as guesses.
3. **User & customer cohorts** — each side of the platform; you design for a specific cohort.
4. **Solutions today** — competitors, operational processes, existing features — or living with it.
5. **Why the business should care** — a number the business tracks; cost of doing nothing; t-shirt sizing or TAM.
6. **How might we…?** — HMW questions from boxes 1–5, each mapped back to its box.
7. **Impact stack-rank** — rank the HMWs; tees up ideation (off-canvas).

Ground rules sit outside the canvas: frameworks slot in and out freely · time-box exceeded → skip a step · it's an insight-capture artifact, not a sequence.

## Brief structure (overview)

The full template lives in [`templates/opportunity-brief.template.md`](templates/opportunity-brief.template.md). Sections:

1. **Metadata** — title, author, contributors, date.
2. **BLUF** — full thesis in 3–5 lines.
3. **SCQA narrative** — why the customer cares (opportunity → cohorts → empathy evidence, pains/gains) → why the business cares (impact → potential) → solutions today.
4. **The opportunity** — the thesis, tied back to the customer (optional GMV/TAM; mark "not covered this iteration" if skipped).
5. **HMWs** — How-Might-We questions from canvas box 6, mapped to the opportunities they address.
6. **HMWs stack-ranked** — by impact (canvas box 7), to tee up ideation.

## ⚠️ Template files you supply

Two template files are referenced here. Working **example** versions ship in `templates/` so the workflow runs out of the box — **replace them with your own** when ready (each file is marked at the top):

- [`templates/opportunity-canvas.md`](templates/opportunity-canvas.md) — the canvas schema Claude generates from.
- [`templates/opportunity-brief.template.md`](templates/opportunity-brief.template.md) — the empty brief Claude fills during Synthesise.
