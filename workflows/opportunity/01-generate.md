# Stage 1 — Generate (🤖 Claude)

> 📋 **This is a prompt.** Paste it into Claude along with your canvas title. (You can also just read it to understand the stage.)

**Goal:** produce a *blank* Opportunity Canvas the team can populate. You are creating the working surface, not filling it in.

**Inputs:** a canvas title (who's struggling with what), plus optionally the team involved and a session time-box.

**The schema is canonical.** Section order, titles, tips, and ground rules come verbatim from [`templates/opportunity-canvas.md`](templates/opportunity-canvas.md). Do not invent, reword, or "improve" them — the template is designed; your job is to instantiate it.

## Surface — offer the best one available, in this order

1. **Miro board** (only if a Miro MCP is connected): build it from the layout spec in [`templates/opportunity-canvas.miro.json`](templates/opportunity-canvas.miro.json) — every coordinate is fixed there; place items verbatim, no improvised geometry. Board named `Opportunity Canvas: <run folder name>`. Cells are plain resizable shapes, tips sit small in each cell's top corner, and ~80% of each cell stays open for the team's stickies. **After building, read the board back and verify** nothing overlaps or crosses a cell edge; fix before reporting done. Record the board URL at the top of the archival markdown copy.
2. **Markdown file** — the universal default; works everywhere. If no Miro MCP is available, use this without interrogating the user (one-line tip that connecting the Miro MCP unlocks board creation is fine). On request, also give a paste-into-Miro variant: a plain bulleted list per section — Miro turns pasted bullets into stickies.

**Always keep a markdown copy** at `runs/<slug>/opportunity-canvas.md` regardless of surface — it's the archival reference for Synthesise. **Naming:** the canvas H1 (and Miro board name) is `Opportunity Canvas: <run folder name>` — artifact and folder always match.

## Process

1. If no canvas title was given, ask: "What should this canvas be called? A good title names who's struggling with what — e.g. 'Homeowners don't rebook after their first job'." Also ask (once, briefly) for the team involved and the session time-box; if the user skips these, proceed and flag them ⚠️ on the canvas rather than stalling.
2. Instantiate the template: all 7 sections, each **empty**, with its tip; ground rules outside the canvas; title, team, and time-box filled in.
3. Tell the user where everything is and what happens next: **Step 2 · Populate** — their team fills it in on a whiteboard, then they run `/synthesise` with the results.

## Do / Don't

- ✅ Sections and tips verbatim from the template.
- ✅ Leave every section **empty** — the content belongs to the team.
- ✅ Include the ground rules: frameworks swap freely; time-box exceeded → skip a step; it's an insight-capture artifact, not a sequence.
- ❌ Don't pre-fill the team's answers.
- ❌ Don't force a framework, or imply the numbering is a script.
- ❌ Don't invent board geometry — the JSON spec is the layout.
