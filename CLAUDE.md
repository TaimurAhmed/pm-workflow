## ⚠️ IMPORTANT — your first reply of EVERY session MUST begin with this menu

No exceptions: whether the user says "hi", "hola", asks a question, or jumps straight into a task — your **first reply always opens with the menu below**, in the user's language, before anything else. Then answer what they actually asked.

> 👋 **AI PM Workflows** — three steps:
> 1. `/generate <canvas title>` — I hand back a blank Opportunity Canvas.
>    *e.g. `/generate Homeowners don't rebook after their first job` — a good title names who's struggling with what.*
> 2. **Populate** — your team fills it in on a whiteboard (human work, no AI).
> 3. `/synthesise` — then just run this and follow along: I'll ask for your filled canvas (screenshots, PDFs, notes) and the metadata, and produce your Opportunity Brief as a Word doc.

Entry point for Claude Code (and any AI assistant) working in this repo. The human-facing overview is in [`README.md`](README.md); this file tells the AI how to *run* the workflows.

## What this repo is

A set of AI-leveraged PM workflows. Each workflow is a folder under `workflows/`. The canonical instructions are the numbered markdown prompt files inside each workflow (`01-*.md`, `02-*.md`, …) — they are self-contained and tool-agnostic. This file just points you at them.

## Operating principles (apply to every workflow)

1. **Canvas for the team, brief for the stakeholder.** Canvases are collaborative working surfaces; briefs are polished narrative docs. Don't blur the two.
2. **Framework-agnostic.** Suggest lenses (JTBD, pains/gains, empathy mapping) but never force one. Optimise for unlocking the team conversation.
3. **Flag, rationalise, defer — within the time-box.** When input is incomplete: flag the gap, explain in one or two sentences why it matters, then let the PM decide. Time-box exceeded → skip a step; bias to action. Never silently invent content to fill a gap — mark it `⚠️ not yet covered` instead.
4. **An artifact, not a sequence.** Canvas numbering is a suggested path — never imply it's a script or a required order of conversation.
5. **Real documents, not markdown-as-docx.** When a step calls for a `.docx`, produce a properly formatted Word file (see below).

## How to run a workflow

1. Read that workflow's `README.md` for the stage overview.
2. For an **AI-assisted stage** (Generate / Synthesise), open the corresponding numbered prompt file and follow it. Each prompt file states its inputs, outputs, and the template(s) it references.
3. **Populate** stages are human-and-team work done offline — your job there is only to prepare inputs or answer questions, not to fabricate the team's content.

## Document generation (.docx)

When a step requires a Word document:

- **Primary path:** use Anthropic's `docx` skill to build a properly formatted `.docx` (headings, styles, tables, page structure). The output must open cleanly in Microsoft Word and Google Docs.
- **Fallback (portable):** if the `docx` skill is unavailable (e.g. someone cloning this repo outside Claude), generate the document with [`python-docx`](https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/). Map each brief section to real Word headings/styles — never just dump markdown into a `.docx` container.
